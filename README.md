# Colorful Apple Documents

_This is a Chrome extension designed to add color to the tags on Apple's developer documentation website, making them easier to distinguish and identify at a glance._

**_Features_**

- **Colored Tags**: Applies different background colors to tags (e.g., "Article", "Sample Code", "Video") in the left navigation bar of Apple documentation pages based on predefined rules.
- **Light/Dark Mode Support**: Colors automatically adjust based on the system's light or dark mode for optimal visibility.
- **Custom Font**: Uses the SF Pro Rounded font (if available) for an appearance closer to Apple's style.

**_Installation_**

_As this is likely a locally developed extension, you can load it in Chrome using these steps:_

1.  _Open Chrome browser._
2.  _Enter `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter._
3.  _Enable the **Developer mode** toggle in the top right corner._
4.  _Click the **Load unpacked** button._
5.  _Select the folder containing the extension files (`manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css`, etc.) ._
6.  _The extension should now be installed and active. Visit an Apple developer documentation page to see the effect._
